**📚 Introduction:** Science teachers face an overwhelming amount of work; from explaining complex concepts to answering endless student queries and preparing assessments. That’s why I created **SciMom**, an AI-powered chatbot to help high school science teachers manage these tasks 🧠. With **Zephyr 7B β** as its backbone, SciMom makes doubt-solving and question paper preparation a breeze!

**💡 Inspiration Behind SciMom:** Growing up, I saw firsthand the challenges my mom faced as a high school science teacher. Her dedication to her students is inspiring, but the extra workload of answering queries and preparing exams was tough 😅. My mother’s dedication inspired me to develop a tool that could help her and others in similar roles. With **SciMom**, I’m helping teachers save time and focus on teaching 💖👩‍🏫.

**⚙️ How SciMom Works:** SciMom runs on the powerful **Zephyr 7B β**, a GPT-like language model fine-tuned on publicly available and synthetic datasets using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). Here’s a breakdown of how it works:

1. **Base Model**: **Zephyr 7B β**, a fine-tuned version of Mistral-7B-v0.1, offering optimized performance on teacher tasks 🤖.

2. **Training Process**: I used **Docker AutoTrain** to fine-tune SciMom with science textbooks, PDFs, and other high-quality resources 📘🔍.
    
3. **Fine-Tuning & Optimization**: Zephyr’s fine-tuning on public datasets and DPO enhances its ability to deliver quick, useful responses while making question paper generation a breeze 📝.

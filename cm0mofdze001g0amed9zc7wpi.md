### 🌟 Why Anti-GPT?

We’ve all been there—closed AI systems like ChatGPT give you a taste of the tech 🍰, but never the full experience. You can’t mess around with the models, can’t customize anything, and let’s be honest, it feels like playing someone else’s game 🎮.

**Anti-GPT flips the script** 📖. We bring together an *Avengers-style team* of models, each a specialist in its field. Need killer chat responses? Done. Want mind-blowing image generation? Easy. Have a PDF you need to interrogate? No problem. And all of it’s open-source, so you can tweak it, remix it, and own it 🔥.
